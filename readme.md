## Install

```
$ npm install unstated-debug
```


## Setup

In the root of your app, import `unstated-debug`:

```js
import React from 'react';
import { render } from 'react-dom';
import { Provide } from 'unstated';
import App from './components/App';
import UNSTATED from 'unstated-debug';

UNSTATED.isEnabled = true;
UNSTATED.logStateChanges = true;

render(
  <Provide>
    <App/>
  </Provide>,
  document.getElementById('root')
);
```

## Usage

When enabled, it exposes a global object `UNSTATED` which you can use in DevTools to explore the containers and their state.

The object contains the following properties:

- `isEnabled` - Same as the below option, but you can change it after init.
- `logStateChanges` - Same as the below option, but you can change it after init.
- `containers` - Your containers.
- `states` - The state objects of your containers.
- `logState()` - Logs the current state of your containers.


## API

### UNSTATED

##### isEnabled

Type: `boolean`<br>
Default: `true`

Toggle debugging.

For example, if you use this in an Electron app, you could pass it [`is.development`](https://github.com/sindresorhus/electron-util#is) to ensure debugging is disabled in production.

##### logStateChanges

Type: `boolean`<br>
Default: `true`

Logs a diff for each state change to the containers. This gives you a live insight into state changes in your app.
